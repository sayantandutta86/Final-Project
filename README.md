# Title: Prediction of a disease outbreak using Monte Carlo Simulation

## Team Member(s): Janki Thakkar, Sayed Shazeb Hussain, Sayantan Dutta

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Purpose for our project is to find if the disease outbreak will affect the major population or not.

Scenario :
In a situation where there is a report of a disease which had infected number of people, in that scenario it would greatly benefit if we are able to forecast whether outbreaks of infectious disease will be major among a population. Infectious disease outbreaks have a reasonable chance of either fading out at an early stage or, in the absence of intervention, spreading widely within the population.
If major outbreaks were predictable in the earliest stages of an outbreak, reactive control strategies could be implemented, such as vaccination, quarantine, or culling. However, such measures are costly, time-consuming, inconvenient, and potentially reduce support for future interventions, thus it is not feasible to implement them for every outbreak.
If it were possible to predict when fadeout was likely to occur, the need for costly precautionary control strategies could be minimized.
We will conduct simulations of data for given possible conditions of a fatal disease outbreak and explore the possibility of predicting a certain range or limit which might be useful for predicting major outbreaks and introduce intervention at the optimum time thus saving life as well as keeping expensive control strategies minimized.

We are considering the sample of different sizes, to calculate the least number of people in red zone it would take to say that the population has a potential outbreak.
For size of n sample, we are simulating the monte carlo upto k number of times or more for every iteration of n sample size to get its mean or true value to determine if that person is
in red zone or not after that we keep on increasing the iteration of n unitll it reaches to the threshold value which we have assumed to be 0.6 to consider the potential outbreak in 
that population.
In simple terms, we are calculating the score of every individual in the sample randomly to see if it's in the redzone. After that, we will do this for all the iterations of n and execute
this k number of times or more for the sample to get the mean value. we are calculating the probability for the sample to be the potential major outbreak as defined below

P(outbreak) = numberofpeople in redzone/ sample size 

Threshold value to consider the population has major outbreak = 0.6

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

We are currently consider 4 variables which we think are more significant than the others:
1) Time difference between the last known patient and the current patient (Tdif) (Normal)
2) Relative Distance (Rd) (Bernoulli) 
3) Contagious Score (cs) (Bernoulli)

Other Factors we are considering to include:
1) Number of contacts per day (Poisson)
2) Immunity level based on gender (Bernoulli)
3) Incubation days (Log-normal)


## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
The factors we are considering for our model is not the exhaustive list of the factors. After research we decided on these factors as they seemed to have a significant effect in our predictions

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)
